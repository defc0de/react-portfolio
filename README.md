#react-portfolio

This is a ReactJS version of my personal portfolio

I initially created my portfolio using Wordpress, for its relatively ease of use and a no-brainer approach for management of content. I wanted to challenge myself and I decided to use a different framework to recreate my Wordpress portfolio. I chose ReactJS as it seems to be the popular choice for building apps in the current web/mobile app development ecosystem.
